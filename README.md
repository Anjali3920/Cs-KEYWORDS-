# COMPUTER SCIENCE BASIC KEYWORDS 
To know about basic computer science  keywords.

# Algorithm:
A set of step-by-step instructions for solving a specific problem or performing a task.


#  Data Structure:
A method of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification, such as arrays, stacks, and queues.


# Variable:
A storage location in programming with an assigned name and value, which can change during program execution.


# Function: 
A reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can be called within a program.


5. Array: A data structure that holds a fixed number of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory.


#  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
A programming paradigm based on objects that contain data and methods, emphasizing reusability and modularity.


# Inheritance: 
An OOP feature where a class derives properties and behaviors from another class.


# Polymorphism: 
An OOP concept where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.


# Encapsulation: 
OOP principle of restricting access to certain details of an object and bundling data with methods that operate on the data.


# Abstraction: 
The concept of hiding complex details to simplify the interaction with a system.


# Recursion: 
A function that calls itself to solve a problem in a divide-and-conquer approach.

# Binary Search: 
An efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array by dividing the search interval in half.


# Hashing:
A technique that maps data to fixed-size values (hash codes) for efficient data retrieval.


# Linked List: 
A data structure consisting of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.


# Queue: 
A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle for adding and removing elements.


# Stack: 
A data structure following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle for adding and removing elements.

# Graph: 
A data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that represent relationships.

# Tree: 
A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes, with no cycles.


#  Sorting:
The process of arranging elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.


# Database: 
A structured collection of data stored and managed electronically.

#  API (Application Programming Interface):
A set of protocols that allows different software applications to communicate.


# Operating System: 
The software that manages hardware resources and provides common services for applications.

# Virtual Machine:
A software-based emulation of a computer that runs an operating system and applications as if on real hardware.

# Cloud Computing: 
Delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, processing, and software.


# Virtualization:
Technology that allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.


# Networking: 
The practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources.


# Protocol:
A set of rules governing data exchange over a network, like HTTP or FTP.

# TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):
A suite of protocols that defines how data is sent over networks.

# Blockchain: 
A decentralized, secure digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers.


# Cybersecurity: 
The practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats.


# Firewall: 
A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.


# Compiler:
A program that translates source code from a high-level programming language into machine code.

# Interpreter: 
A program that executes code line by line, often used in scripting languages.
