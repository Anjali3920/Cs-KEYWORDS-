# Hosting a Website on AWS with Apache2 Using PowerShell
(These are the steps after launching instance and downloading .pem passkey)





Step 1: Connect to EC2 Instance Using PowerShell
Open PowerShell in Windows.
Navigate to your PEM file: First, ensure youâ€™re in the directory where your .pem file is located. Use cd to change directories:
cd path\to\your-pem-file
Use the ssh command to connect to your EC2 instance:
ssh -i "path_to_your_key.pem" ec2-user@your_instance_public_IP
Replace path_to_your_key.pem with the location of your private key. Replace your_instance_public_IP with the public IP of your EC2 instance.

Step 2: Update the Package List on Your EC2 Instance
Run the following command after logging in to update your packages:

sudo apt update
Step 3: Install Apache2
To install the Apache2 web server:

sudo apt install apache2 -y
Step 4: Delete the Default index.html and Create Your Own
Navigate to the Apache web directory:

cd /var/www/html
Delete the default index.html file:
sudo rm index.html
Create a new index.html file:
sudo vi index.html
Add your website's HTML content and save the file.
YAY! Your link or IP adress of your instance will now work.
